# UltraInstest

## 1. Introduction
Dragon ball was one of my favorite childhood anime (to be honest even until now :-)). In the tournament of power series, Goku (the main character) used
the "Ultra Instict" power. This power was like Goku's ultimate power. Thinking that this tool is a powerful tool, so I named the tool "UltraInstest".

UltraInstest is an automated software test tool. The concept of the tool is to speed-up the testing process and to reduce cost at the same time.
Software testing is one of the crucial part in software development. Before releasing a software or even before committing our changes into database or repository,
we always need to make sure that our changes are working and at least the basic functionality still behaving correctly.

The tool is designed to easily verify or test software features/functionalities.(e.g. smoke test, regression test, software test, software integration test).
It is user-friendly as it is developed in GUI form and also very flexible to adapt from one project to another.
