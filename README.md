# UltraInstest

## 1. Introduction
UltraInstest is an automated software test tool. The concept of the tool is to speed-up the testing process and to reduce cost at the same time.
Software testing is one of the crucial part in software development. Before we release a software or even before committing our changes into database or repository,
we always need to make sure that our changes is working and at least the basic functionality of the product is still behaving correctly.

The tool is designed to easily verify or test software features/functionalities.(e.g. smoke test, regression test, software test, software integration test).
It is user-friendly as it is developed in GUI form and also very flexible to adapt from one project to another.
